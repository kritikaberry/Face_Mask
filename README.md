# Face_Mask Detector
The improvised Face-Mask detector detects the
surgical mask on a face, while also persuading the user to
wear a mask. Not only this, it also contains a normal face
detector. As per the problem statement, we have
shown the difference between the normal and
improvised face detector with masks.

The most commonly used and available masks are the
surgical masks. Hence, the dataset used to train the
model consists of human faces with surgical masks.

“Mask It” also provides useful links to the covid-19
live tracker and then daily news updates. Hence, the
user can use “Mask It” as a portal for useful links
regarding covid-19 along with a face-mask detector.

As the current scenario is evident, it’s use can be
employed in public places like markets and malls. It can
also be used to ensure that all employees in corporate
spaces are wearing masks at all times.
